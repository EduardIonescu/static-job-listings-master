## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Filter job listings based on the categories

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Fetch
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

-   React and some of its hooks.
-   How to fetch data in React.
-   States in react should be considered Read-only so you have to manipulate the data by using setState.
-   The project can be so much easier and cleaner to develop using React, compared to Vanilla JS.

### Continued development

I want to practice React further and learn to use NextJS to make the whole process cleaner and better for development and deployment.
I also want to look into Animations to make the webpage feel more alive.

### Useful resources

-   [reactjs.org tutorial](https://beta.reactjs.org/) - This helped me better understand how State management and hooks work. It also helped me realize why some standards are necessary, for example thinking of state as immutable.
-   [freeCodeCamp React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react) - Even if it is a little bit outdated, it helped me relearn the basics of react.
